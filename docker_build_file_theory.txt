Docker concentrate on 3 things:

1. Docker file: A blueprint for building images
2. Docker image: Image is a template for running containers
3. Docker container: The container is the actual process where we have the package project

Docker Main CMD

FROM — This command is used to provide a base image

ADD/COPY — This command would add the program file to the container

RUN — this command would install additional dependencies or packages like NumPy, pandas

CMD — this command would specify the executable path of the program.



Example:-

FROM python:3.8

# specifies that the base image is python 3.8

ADD LinearRegression.py.

# add/ copy specifies to add the program file LinearRegression to the container current folder. The period, in the end, specifies the current folder.

RUN pip install NumPy sklearn

# this would install NumPy, sklearn packages to the container

CMD [ “python”, “./LinearRegression.py”]

# specifies the executable path of the program and running the python file in the container.
